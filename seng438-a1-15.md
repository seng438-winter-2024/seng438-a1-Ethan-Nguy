# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

#### Scope

During our exploratory testing, our main focus was on the system's functional requirements. Consequently, non-functional requirements, such as performance, usability, etc. were not explored. To establish a practical testing scope, we decided to primarily focus on targeting the key functionalities that would be  critical to the system's core operation. This included inserting a valid and invalid card and attempting to perform all of the basic transactions including withdrawals, deposits, transfers and balance inquiries.

#### Approach

The testing approach will be a combination of basic testing and a in-depth exploration of critical operations. Operations that carry significant financial implications for the users, such as withdrawal, deposit and transfers of money, would undergo extensive testing due to their potential to result in loss of money. Whereas functionalities such as balance inquiry will receive a more basic level of testing, as it present a lower risk of monetary loss. 


#### Test Case Development

Test cases will be be designed to cover both common usage scenarios and edge cases (exceptional scenarios). The test cases will particularly eb derived from user stories/ real-world scenarios to ensure they are representative of actual user interaction with the system. Given the exploratory nature of testing, some test cases may be created on the go in response to discoveries made.
